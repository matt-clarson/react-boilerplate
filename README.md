# React Boilerplate

Boilerplate for a React, Tailwind, and Typescript application.

## Use

To use, run the following command:

```bash
npx degit matt-clarson/react-boilerplate#main <project-dir-name>
```

This will create a new project at `project-dir-name`.

You should edit the `package.json` in your new project, changing the `name`, `version`, `description`, `author`, `keywords`, and `license` fields to whatever makes sense for the project.

## Includes

- React
- Tailwind
- Typescript
- Snowpack
- Jest
  - React Testing Library
- Eslint
- Prettier
- Basic package.json scripts
- A good .gitignore file (from https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore)
